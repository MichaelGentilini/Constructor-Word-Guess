# Constructor-Word-Guess


###This is version of Hangman using Node.js and constructor functions

 - The application is started with the command *node Index or node Index.js
 - The user is presented with a series of underscores representing the word 
 - The user starts with 15 guesses
 - The user may enter any letter in the alphabet
 - Validation is ran to ensure the input is not empty, a letter already used, mutiple letters, or a character other than letter
 - If the user fails to guess the word or, guesses correctly, the answer is shown, and another word is presented
 - This also uses [Npm-inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) with RegEx validation
